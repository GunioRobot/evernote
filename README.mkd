# evernote #
This gem is a high level wrapper around Evernote's Thrift-generated ruby code. It currently just bundles up Evernote's thrift-generated code. After installing, just require the gem in your project:

require 'evernote'

# future releases #
This gem will eventually provide a cleaner API around the generated code, so you don't feel like you're writing Java.
